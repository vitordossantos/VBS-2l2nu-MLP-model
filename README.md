This repository contains my work on developing a robust custom callback function and a significance metric, in Keras, to select the best training epoch, in a 200 epochs training set, of a shallow MLP with a single hidden layer of 200 neurons. The model was trained and validated using the Ultra Legacy 2018 MC simulations with PTDy and NLO VBS.
